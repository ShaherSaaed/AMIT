## Quesions to ask
* What is the differnce between a method with parentheses and without parentheses


**Answer:**

In short, function with parenthesis () is actually calling (invoke) that function whereas function without parenthesis () is an object of that function which can be passed as an argument and later be called by appending () to it.

def hello():
    return 1
i.e.
hello >> returns object
hello() >> outputs 1
